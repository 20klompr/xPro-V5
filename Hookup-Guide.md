# Connect Power Supply

Please note: The xPro-V5 utilizes Trinamic 5160 stepper drivers running at up to 4A RMS, and over 6A peak - we recommend using a UL listed 24v Power Supply rated at or above 300W (such as the Meanwell LRS350 24v Power Supply)
  

## Set the 115/230v Switch

Before connecting your power supply to mains power, it is critical that you check and set the 115v/230v Switch on your PSU.

## Connecting 24v Power Supply to the xPro-V5

Connect Positive ("+24V") and Negative ("GND") from your Power Supply to the xPro-V5 using the supplied [(5mm) Connector](https://media.digikey.com/Photos/On%20Shore%20Technology%20Photos/OSTTJ027150.jpg).
